# How I worked on this project

### I started off with the intention of creating a project that keeps track of all the errors that a program runs into. The idea was based off of something I had to do in one of my Software Engineering classes during my undergrad studies, where my team had to upload our term project to a code quality checker and see what improvements can be made. Error Tracking Tool, however, is a little different, where it only shows what errors are being caused when running the program, be it syntax errors or run-time errors.

# How to navigate this project

### The project files are divided into different sections, with the files relying heavily on the redux library conjugated into a single folder, the UI and the backend of the functions being seen to the user are in one section, and the sidebar frontend components are in one section

# Why I built the project this way

### I created the project this way to keep it organized and easy to navigate when in a hurry. Every section is labeled to direct the user to whichever part of the program they'd like to navigate (e.g. Controllers/Redux, Models, siddebar, Views, and components)

# If I had more time I would change this

### I wouldn't necessarily change anything but if I had more time I'd like add a client/server side to the application to make it more interactive. This would allow multiple users to get on the application and have a form of communication with one another, something that can be very powerful when reviewing code in a hybrid fashion.
